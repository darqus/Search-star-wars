Growing up on the desert world Tatooine, Anakin Skywalker never thought he would venture beyond the small life he has. Simple, boyhood pursuits seem like the only things he should be concerned with. But destiny has other things in mind... Plot summary On the galactic frontier of the Outer Rim, the planet Tatooine orbits the inner edge of the twin suns Tatoo I and Tatoo II. A clan of Jawas loots a crashed starship while a band of Tusken Raiders watches on from the cliffs overhead. As one observes the Jawas through a pair of electrobinoculars, two Tuskens pore over a poster advertising the Boonta Eve Classic podrace. The Tuskens mount their banthas and follow the Jawa procession towards the spaceport settlement of Mos Espa. There, in the junkyard owned by the Toydarian junk dealer Watto, the slave boy Anakin Skywalker works under a large bin with a fusioncutter, and is watched keenly by a womp rat. The critter dashes into a tripwire, springing a trap and causing Anakin to bump his head in the commotion. He's met by Amee, who notices the ensnared womp rat. Anakin cuts it free, stating that all living things should be free, and continues to search for parts for his secret podracer. The pair spot a herd of banthas, unusually close to the settlement, which Anakin suggests is because a storm is coming. Attempting to return to the shop before he can be yelled at by Watto, Anakin again encounters the womp rat, which sits on a gleaming energy binder. Surprised, Anakin inspects the device, having usually been able to know where to find things in Watto's junkyard. Anakin's inspection is interrupted by Watto, whose yelling in Huttese brings the boy and Amee inside the shop. He tasks Anakin with obtaining a thermal veristat and Thruster relays from the visiting Jawas, and admonishes Anakin for destroying his podracer in the boy's last race. Watto threatens to beat Anakin blind, to which the boy quips that he would not be able to race if he was blind. Watto points out that he doesn't have a podracer to fly anyway, and sends Anakin away. The boy meets his mother, Shmi Skywalker, who asks him to buy fruit from Jira on his way. He asks her to hide his new energy binder, and sets off for the plaza. Wandering through the crowds, Anakin is accosted by his friends Kitster and Wald, the latter of whom has acquired a peggat Kitster hopes to spend on a ruby bliel. The boys stop off at Jira's stall, and learn her cooling unit has broken down. She gives Anakin some pika fruits for his mother, and Anakin promises to find a replacement unit in the junkyard. They head for Maggy the Gorgon's, but happen upon Sebulba the Dug in the street, admonishing his band over his entrance music for the podrace. Sebulba mocks Anakin about his crash in their last race, and Anakin accuses his rival of cheating and killing fellow racer Rimkar. The two square off, and are about to scuffle when a cantina patron is knocked through the doorway of Maggy's, interrupting the pair. An old spacer and previous acquaintance of Anakin's sees Sebulba off, and warns the slave boys not to go into Maggy's today, instead giving them a ruby bliel to share. Anakin asks the retired pilot to tell him about the Angels of Iego again when he comes back. Anakin vows that one day he'll become a deep-space pilot and walk on all the planets. As Anakin catches up with his friends, a Duros asks the spacer why he bothers talking to the slave, to which the old human replies that there is something about Anakin. The pair laugh it off and return inside Maggy's, where the Xexto podracer Gasgano is in the midst of a violent bar brawl. Forcing his opponents to exclaim the virtues of his Ord Pedrovia podracer, Gasgano is bitten by a Gran. Meanwhile, Aldar Beedo and Wan Sandage negotiate a deal to eliminate Sebulba from the race, while Ark Roose watches Skywalker from the window, plotting his revenge against the boy. Unbeknownst, Anakin and his friends find the Jawa traders, but only in time to watch a pit droid buying exactly the parts Skywalker is looking for. Back at the shop, Watto is furious with Anakin, and makes him clean the bins again. Anakin gives his mother the fruit from Jira, and Shmi takes a moment to look at her son, momentarily fearing that she might not see him again. Seeing him off, Shmi warns Anakin of the approaching storm. In the junkyard, Anakin again discovers the womp rat he saved, now standing on a cooling unit. Anakin sits on top of it happily, and stares up at the sky in time to spot a ship coming in a high speed. Anakin wonders if it was an Angel, and dreams of one leading warriors into battle on planets without number. He sees himself as a Jedi, holding a glowing lightsaber as chained hands reach out to him imploringly. However, he is stirred from his vision by Watto's voice, and arrives at the shop in time to find the Toydarian has visitors: Qui-Gon Jinn, Jar Jar Binks, R2-D2, and the beautiful young Padmé Naberrie, whom Skywalker thinks of as the Angel of his dreams. Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones is a 2002 film directed by George Lucas and written by Lucas and Jonathan Hales. It is the second part of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. The film is set nine years after the Battle of Naboo, when the galaxy is on the brink of civil war. Under the leadership of renegade Jedi Master Count Dooku, thousands of systems threaten to secede from the Republic. When an assassination attempt is made on Senator Padmé Amidala, the former Queen of Naboo, Jedi apprentice Anakin Skywalker is assigned to protect her, while his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi is assigned to investigate the assassination attempt. Soon the Jedi are drawn into the heart of the Separatist movement, and the beginning of a new threat to the galaxy: the Clone Wars. Attack of the Clones was the first Star Wars film to use a high-definition digital 24-frame system for most of the its live-action scenes. The film was a financial success, grossing over $600 million at the worldwide box office. However, for the first time, a Star Wars film did not earn the highest box-office sales for the year; Attack of the Clones ended up fourth behind The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, and Spider-Man. Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith is a 2005 film written and directed by George Lucas. It is the third and final part of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Three years after the First Battle of Geonosis and onset of the Clone Wars, the noble Jedi Knights have been leading a massive clone army into a galaxy-wide battle against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic reveals his true nature as a Sith Lord as he unveils a plot to rule the galaxy by transforming the Republic into a Galactic Empire. Jedi hero Anakin Skywalker is seduced by the dark side of the Force to become Darth Sidious's new apprentice Darth Vader. The Jedi are all but eliminated with Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Master Yoda forced into hiding. The only hope for the galaxy is Anakin's own offspring—the twin children born in secrecy who will grow up to become Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa. Revenge of the Sith was released in theaters on Thursday, May 19, 2005 (the same day that the first episode of the prequel trilogy The Phantom Menace was released in 1999), and premiered (out of competition) on the 2005 Cannes Festival May 15. The film was generally positively received by critics, especially in comparison to the two previous prequels. It broke several box office records in its opening week and went on to earn over US $800 million worldwide, making it one of the top-grossing movies of 2005. It is the second Star Wars film which used a high-definition digital 24 frame system for most of the movie's live-action scenes. The film was re-released in the Blu-ray format in September of 2011. On November 12, 2019, the film was included with the launch of Disney+. Episode IV: A New Hope Read-Along Storybook and CD is a young-readers' story from Disney–Lucasfilm Press, released on February 10, 2015, written by Randy Thornton and illustrated by Brian Rood. It presents an illustrated version of the story of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope and also features an accompanying CD with narration of the story and character voices. Publisher summary Experience Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope like never before! Fully illustrated with gorgeous images by Star Wars artist Brian Rood, this epic storybook also includes a CD with word-for-word narration, music, and character voices. Follow along as Luke Skywalker meets Obi-Wan Kenobi, rescues Princess Leia, and faces Darth Vader for the first time. Plot summary In a galaxy torn by conflict, a vessel carrying secret plans for the Galactic Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, races towards Tatooine. It is intercepted by the Devastator, an Imperial-class Star Destroyer, but before the Empire's agents have time to the search the ship, the Princess Leia Organa hides the plans in the memory banks of the droid R2-D2 and sends him and his companion, C-3PO, in an escape pod to Tatooine. Leia Organa is captured by the feared agent of the Empire, the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Vader, but refuses to provide him with any information. Being that she is an Imperial Senator, he declares her a traitor to the Empire and orders her taken away for questioning. On the planet Tatooine, the droids find themselves captured by Jawa scavengers. They are then sold to the moisture farmer Owen Lars, who tells his nephew, Luke Skywalker, to clean them up so that they can be of service on the Lars moisture farm. While examining the droids, Luke accidentally activates a portion of a secret message programmed in the R2 series astromech droid, R2-D2. The holographic message depicts the woman from the Tantive IV, Leia Organa, stating \\\"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.\\\" Skywalker is dazzled by the image of the beautiful woman. He isn't sure who \\\"Obi-Wan Kenobi\\\" is, but does know of an old Ben Kenobi, a sort of strange old hermit who lives out beyond the Dune Sea. Fearing that the droids may have been stolen, Luke sets off in a landspeeder to pay a visit to Ben Kenobi. Upon arrival, Kenobi is able to access the full message stored within R2's databanks, which is a message from Leia Organa appealing to Kenobi in the name of his service during the Clone Wars, asking him to deliver the droids to Alderaan, as the R2 unit contains information vital to the continued survival of the Rebel Alliance. At this point, Kenobi informs Skywalker that he was once a Jedi Knight, as Skywalker's father was. Skywalker is surprised, as he didn't know his father was ever a Jedi. Kenobi gives Skywalker his father's lightsaber and tells him that he must learn the ways of the Force if he's to come with him to Alderaan. Skywalker, not ready to give up his life on Tatooine, tells him that he can only take him as far as Anchorhead. Kenobi grimly replies that he must do what he feels is right. While traveling to Anchorhead, the group discovers that the Jawa sandcrawler with had previously borne R2-D2 and C-3PO had been destroyed by Imperial forces. Skywalker realizes that this means the Imperials would have tracked the trail back to the Lars homestead, but it's too late, and the entire property has been destroyed. Turning to Kenobi, he tells him that he wants to join him on his mission to Alderaan. The two travel to Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina, where they meet with Han Solo of the Millennium Falcon and his Wookiee co-pilot, Chewbacca. They make a deal to travel on Solo's ship to travel to Alderaan and while they head off to sell their landspeeder for some extra money, Solo has a discussion with Jabba, a vicious Hutt that he owes money too. The two come to an agreement that Solo can pay him after completing this next charter, but if he fails again, then Jabba will bring down an army of bounty hunters upon him. As the Millennium Falcon departs for Alderaan, an unpleasant scene unfolds upon the Death Star. Princess Leia Organa is brought before the station's commander, Wilhuff Tarkin, who tells her that before her execution, he'd like her to witness \\\"a ceremony that will make this battle station fully operational.\\\" The full force and power of the station's feared weapon, the superlaser, is then brought to bear on Alderaan, completely obliterating Organa's home planet. At the same time, the Millennium Falcon emerges from hyperspace, only for the crew to find that the planet they're trying to reach apparently isn't there, only a \\\"small moon.\\\" Obi-Wan Kenobi, however, realizes \\\"That's no moon. That's a space station.\\\" The ship is quickly caught in a tractor beam from said space station and pulled in. When Imperial forces search the ship, however, they find it empty, as everyone has hidden in secret compartments. Once the Imperial forces leave, the group emerges and sneaks on-board the Death Star. Obi-Wan Kenobi sets off to disable the tractor beam and as he does so, the droid R2-D2 plugs into an Imperial computer and discovers that Leia Organa is aboard the station. Skywalker convinces Solo and Chewbacca to join him on a rescue mission to save the princess. He and Solo disguise themselves as Imperial stormtroopers that are escorting their prisoner, Chewbacca. The ruse works and Skywalker discovers the Princess's cell. He informs her of who he is and that he's come to rescue her. The group beats a hasty retreat as stormtroopers bear down, but it soon becomes clear that they have no real plan of escape. Organa, unimpressed, decides to create her own plan and directs the group to take refuge down a garbage chute. The group lands safely on a pile of smelly garbage, but then finds the walls closing in on them. They've landed in a garbage masher. They are very nearly crushed, but Luke Skywalker suddenly remembers the droids and pages R2-D2 on his comlink, getting him to shut the garbage masher down. While all of this happens, Ben Kenobi finds the controls for the tractor beam and disables it. On his way back to the Millennium Falcon, however, he encounters Darth Vader, his former student who has now turned to the dark side of the Force. As the two engage in a fierce duel, Skywalker and the others make for the Millennium Falcon, but Skywalker is shocked when Kenobi seems to simply stop fighting in the middle of the duel, his robes collapsing in a crumpled heap as Vader swings through them. Skywalker is horrified by what he is just witnessed, but there is no time for mourning as he and the others escape the Death Star. Before making the leap to hyperspace, the crew fights off four Imperial TIE/ln space superiority starfighters. They arrive safely at the Rebel base on Yavin 4, but have no time to celebrate, as the Empire placed a homing beacon on the Millennium Falcon, leading them directly to the Rebels. With the secret plans in their possession, however, the Rebels are able to put together a plan-of-action and launch their X-wing starfighters against the Empire's forces, which even include a TIE fighter flown by Darth Vader himself. In a fierce and challenging battle, after one of the rebel pilots fails to hit the Death Star's weak spot, everything is up to Luke Skywalker, whom Vader has right on his tail. Noting \\\"The Force is strong is strong with this one,\\\" Vader prepares to fire, only for a laser blast to impact the vessel of his wingman, sending his own ship careening off into space. Solo comms that Skywalker is clear and as Skywalker makes his run, he hears the voice of Ben Kenobi telling him to \\\"use the Force.\\\" He fires two proton torpedos, landing a direct hit that causes the Death Star to explode. Back on Yavin, everyone gathers to celebrate this great victory over the Empire. Both Han Solo and Luke Skywalker are awarded Medals of Bravery by Leia Organa, but though everyone is happy for their victory, they know that the Empire, Darth Vader and the feared Galactic Emperor remain a grave threat.[4] Omissions and modifications A New Hope Read-Along Storybook and CD is a picture book and audio retelling of the events of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, but omits a number of details and scenes to fit the story within the format of a 32-page picture book. The opening scene aboard the Tantive IV is presented largely as it is in the film, simply omitting certain dialogue unnecessary to the story. The story then skips ahead to C-3PO and R2-D2 being captured by the Jawa scavengers, the details of the journey through the desert omitted. Luke Skywalker's story begins with him visiting the Jawas to purchase the droids with Owen Lars, though Owen himself is not pictured. R5-D4 appears only in the book's illustration. The story continues with Luke examining the droids in the garage, omitting all material with Luke speaking with his aunt and uncle and the character of Beru Whitesun Lars entirely. R2-D2 is shown playing back the message from Leia Organa, but there is no mention of Luke attempting to remove a restraining bolt from him, nor having placed it in the first place. Rather than R2-D2 escaping into the Jundland Wastes, it is instead suggested that Luke boards his landspeeder directly with both droids and proceeds directly to deliver them to Obi-Wan Kenobi, fearing that they had been stolen. As such, all scenes involving the Tusken Raiders and the danger in the desert are omitted. Upon arrival, Kenobi discovers the full message from Organa immediately and only tells Luke Skywalker of his history as a Jedi and offers him his father's lightsaber after the message has been played, though he does not tell Luke that Darth Vader killed his father. The scene following, in which those on the Death Star receive news of the dissolution of the Imperial Senate and in which Vader chokes Admiral Conan Antonio Motti, is omitted entirely. The story continues with Skywalker and Kenobi finding the Lars homestead destroyed and traveling to Mos Eisley, though they are not shown encountering the stormtroopers, nor does Skywalker get into trouble in the Mos Eisley Cantina. Han Solo is not shown having to fend off Greedo, thus skirting the question of who shot first, though he is shown talking with Jabba the Hutt and promising him that he now has a \\\"nice easy charter\\\" and will be able to pay him back. On the Death Star, Leia Organa is taken before Wilhuff Tarkin, but there is never any mention of her being tortured for information and while Alderaan is destroyed, it seems to be done simply out of spite and to horrify Organa. The story then arrives at the Millennium Falcon emerging from hyperspace, with Skywalker's training with Ben Kenobi and the game of dejarik between R2-D2 and Chewbacca depicted only the book's front cover. The arrival at the Death Star and hiding then boarding is largely the same as in the film, though no reference is made to Vader detecting a familiar presence. Luke's persuasion of Solo is only briefly described and no mention is made of the droids being left behind during the rescue of Princess Leia, nor of the difficulties the group encounters prior to them actually escaping with the princess. Though the garbage compactor scene is depicted, the living creature within it is not mentioned. The remainder of the events of the escape from the Death Star are highly compressed, with the group described as simply escaping from the garbage masher and then arriving at the docking bay, where they witness the battle between Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi. This is described generally as it occurs in the film, with the Millennium Falcon's escape and battle with TIE fighters described in a couple of brief sentences. Following the Millennium Falcon's arrival at the Rebel base, all scenes involving the discussion of how to take down the Death Star and Luke Skywalker meeting up with Biggs Darklighter are omitted. Additionally, no mention is made of Han Solo choosing to leave with Chewbacca in order to pay his debt to Jabba. The story instead proceeds immediately to the Rebel Alliance's assault against the Death Star. This is described in a few brief paragraphs with no mention of Wedge Antilles, nor by name of any Rebel pilot other than Skywalker. None of the scenes during the battle on the Death Star itself are depicted. Following the battle, the story ends with a depiction of Skywalker and Solo being presented with medals of valor.

It presents an illustrated version of the story of Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back and also features an accompanying CD with narration of the story and character voices. Publisher summary The Rebellion faces its darkest hour in Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back.

The film was re-released in the Blu-ray format in September of 2011. Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, marketed as Star Wars: The Force Awakens, is a 2015 film directed by J.J. Abrams; co-written by Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan, and Michael Arndt; and produced by Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy and Bad Robot Productions. It is the first part of the Star Wars sequel trilogy. The film stars Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Anthony Daniels, and Peter Mayhew reprising their original roles. The original actors are joined by a host of new actors including Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, and Oscar Isaac. The story begins thirty years after the events of Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. The First Order has risen from the ashes of the Galactic Empire and is opposed by General Leia Organa and the Resistance, both of which seek to find the missing Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. In the midst of this search, new heroes rise in the form of Rey, a 19 year-old girl and a Force-sensitive scavenger from Jakku; Finn, a stormtrooper who defected from the First Order; and Poe Dameron, the best pilot in the Resistance. They are aided by Han Solo in their search for Skywalker and their mission to destroy the First Order's new superweapon, Starkiller Base, which targets the New Republic and the Resistance for destruction. They are opposed by villains such as Kylo Ren, a dark warrior with a mysterious past; and General Armitage Hux, the commander of Starkiller Base. Despite initially claiming that the Star Wars story ended with the redemption of Anakin Skywalker in Return of the Jedi, and after spending years refuting speculation that there would be another film, Star Wars creator George Lucas began work on Episode VII in 2011 in order to increase the value of Lucasfilm before he sold it to The Walt Disney Company, although Disney would later elect to not use Lucas' story. The acquisition was finalized on October 30, 2012. Disney and Lucasfilm officially announced Episode VII and the sequel trilogy the same day. Lucasfilm later announced that the film would be an original story not beholden to the continuity of the Star Wars Expanded Universe, which was rebranded as the non-canon Star Wars Legends. The Force Awakens was released on December 17, 2015 in the United Kingdom, Mexico, Latin America, and Asian countries; December 18, 2015 in North America; and January 9, 2016 in China. Some North American theaters offered special limited advance showings on the evening of December 17th rather than the traditional midnight showing. The film received widespread critical praise upon its release and was a massive box office success, becoming the highest grossing film of all time in North America when not adjusted for inflation. Worldwide, the film was the third highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release (behind Avatar and Titanic). It is currently the fourth highest-grossing film of all time (behind Avengers: Endgame, Avatar and Titanic).

The Last Jedi begins immediately after the events of Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, set thirty years after the conclusion of the original Star Wars trilogy. It continues the story of Rey and her discovery of the exiled Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, along with the story of the war between General Leia Organa's Resistance and the First Order. The film was released on December 14, 2017 in Hong Kong, Mexico, Latin America, and European countries; December 15, 2017 in North America; and January 5, 2018 in China.

The film was first announced after The Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm Ltd. in 2012. Colin Trevorrow was initially announced as the director and writer of the film, but he and Lucasfilm parted ways in September 2017, with Lucasfilm citing \\\"creative differences\\\" over the project. On September 12, 2017, Abrams and Terrio were announced as the new director and writers. Principal photography began in 2018, and filming wrapped in 2019.

Simple, boyhood pursuits\n        seem like the only things he should be concerned with. But destiny has\n        other things in mind... Plot summary On the galactic frontier of the\n        Outer Rim, the planet Tatooine orbits the inner edge of the twin suns\n        Tatoo I and Tatoo II. A clan of Jawas loots a crashed starship while a\n        band of Tusken Raiders watches on from the cliffs overhead. As one\n        observes the Jawas through a pair of electrobinoculars, two Tuskens pore\n        over a poster advertising the Boonta Eve Classic podrace. The Tuskens\n        mount their banthas and follow the Jawa procession towards the spaceport\n        settlement of Mos Espa. There, in the junkyard owned by the Toydarian\n        junk dealer Watto, the slave boy Anakin Skywalker works under a large\n        bin with a fusioncutter, and is watched keenly by a womp rat. The\n        critter dashes into a tripwire, springing a trap and causing Anakin to\n        bump his head in the commotion. He's met by Amee, who notices the\n        ensnared womp rat. Anakin cuts it free, stating that all living things\n        should be free, and continues to search for parts for his secret\n        podracer. The pair spot a herd of banthas, unusually close to the\n        settlement, which Anakin suggests is because a storm is coming.\n        Attempting to return to the shop before he can be yelled at by Watto,\n        Anakin again encounters the womp rat, which sits on a gleaming energy\n        binder. Surprised, Anakin inspects the device, having usually been able\n        to know where to find things in Watto's junkyard. Anakin's inspection is\n        interrupted by Watto, whose yelling in Huttese brings the boy and Amee\n        inside the shop. He tasks Anakin with obtaining a thermal veristat and\n        Thruster relays from the visiting Jawas, and admonishes Anakin for\n        destroying his podracer in the boy's last race. Watto threatens to beat\n        Anakin blind, to which the boy quips that he would not be able to race\n        if he was blind. Watto points out that he doesn't have a podracer to fly\n        anyway, and sends Anakin away. The boy meets his mother, Shmi Skywalker,\n        who asks him to buy fruit from Jira on his way. He asks her to hide his\n        new energy binder, and sets off for the plaza. Wandering through the\n        crowds, Anakin is accosted by his friends Kitster and Wald, the latter\n        of whom has acquired a peggat Kitster hopes to spend on a ruby bliel.\n        The boys stop off at Jira's stall, and learn her cooling unit has broken\n        down. She gives Anakin some pika fruits for his mother, and Anakin\n        promises to find a replacement unit in the junkyard. They head for Maggy\n        the Gorgon's, but happen upon Sebulba the Dug in the street, admonishing\n        his band over his entrance music for the podrace. Sebulba mocks Anakin\n        about his crash in their last race, and Anakin accuses his rival of\n        cheating and killing fellow racer Rimkar. The two square off, and are\n        about to scuffle when a cantina patron is knocked through the doorway of\n        Maggy's, interrupting the pair. An old spacer and previous acquaintance\n        of Anakin's sees Sebulba off, and warns the slave boys not to go into\n        Maggy's today, instead giving them a ruby bliel to share. Anakin asks\n        the retired pilot to tell him about the Angels of Iego again when he\n        comes back. Anakin vows that one day he'll become a deep-space pilot and\n        walk on all the planets. As Anakin catches up with his friends, a Duros\n        asks the spacer why he bothers talking to the slave, to which the old\n        human replies that there is something about Anakin. The pair laugh it\n        off and return inside Maggy's, where the Xexto podracer Gasgano is in\n        the midst of a violent bar brawl. Forcing his opponents to exclaim the\n        virtues of his Ord Pedrovia podracer, Gasgano is bitten by a Gran.\n        Meanwhile, Aldar Beedo and Wan Sandage negotiate a deal to eliminate\n        Sebulba from the race, while Ark Roose watches Skywalker from the\n        window, plotting his revenge against the boy. Unbeknownst, Anakin and\n        his friends find the Jawa traders, but only in time to watch a pit droid\n        buying exactly the parts Skywalker is looking for. Back at the shop,\n        Watto is furious with Anakin, and makes him clean the bins again. Anakin\n        gives his mother the fruit from Jira, and Shmi takes a moment to look at\n        her son, momentarily fearing that she might not see him again. Seeing\n        him off, Shmi warns Anakin of the approaching storm. In the junkyard,\n        Anakin again discovers the womp rat he saved, now standing on a cooling\n        unit. Anakin sits on top of it happily, and stares up at the sky in time\n        to spot a ship coming in a high speed. Anakin wonders if it was an\n        Angel, and dreams of one leading warriors into battle on planets without\n        number. He sees himself as a Jedi, holding a glowing lightsaber as\n        chained hands reach out to him imploringly. However, he is stirred from\n        his vision by Watto's voice, and arrives at the shop in time to find the\n        Toydarian has visitors: Qui-Gon Jinn, Jar Jar Binks, R2-D2, and the\n        beautiful young Padmé Naberrie, whom Skywalker thinks of as the Angel of\n        his dreams. Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones is a 2002 film\n        directed by George Lucas and written by Lucas and Jonathan Hales. It is\n        the second part of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. The film is set nine\n        years after the Battle of Naboo, when the galaxy is on the brink of\n        civil war. Under the leadership of renegade Jedi Master Count Dooku,\n        thousands of systems threaten to secede from the Republic. When an\n        assassination attempt is made on Senator Padmé Amidala, the former Queen\n        of Naboo, Jedi apprentice Anakin Skywalker is assigned to protect her,\n        while his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi is assigned to investigate the\n        assassination attempt. Soon the Jedi are drawn into the heart of the\n        Separatist movement, and the beginning of a new threat to the galaxy:\n        the Clone Wars. Attack of the Clones was the first Star Wars film to use\n        a high-definition digital 24-frame system for most of the its\n        live-action scenes. The film was a financial success, grossing over $600\n        million at the worldwide box office. However, for the first time, a Star\n        Wars film did not earn the highest box-office sales for the year; Attack\n        of the Clones ended up fourth behind The Lord of the Rings: The Two\n        Towers, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, and Spider-Man. Star\n        Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith is a 2005 film written and\n        directed by George Lucas. It is the third and final part of the Star\n        Wars prequel trilogy. Three years after the First Battle of Geonosis and\n        onset of the Clone Wars, the noble Jedi Knights have been leading a\n        massive clone army into a galaxy-wide battle against the Confederacy of\n        Independent Systems. The Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic\n        reveals his true nature as a Sith Lord as he unveils a plot to rule the\n        galaxy by transforming the Republic into a Galactic Empire. Jedi hero\n        Anakin Skywalker is seduced by the dark side of the Force to become\n        Darth Sidious's new apprentice Darth Vader. The Jedi are all but\n        eliminated with Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Master Yoda forced into hiding.\n        The only hope for the galaxy is Anakin's own offspring—the twin children\n        born in secrecy who will grow up to become Luke Skywalker and Leia\n        Organa. Revenge of the Sith was released in theaters on Thursday, May\n        19, 2005 (the same day that the first episode of the prequel trilogy The\n        Phantom Menace was released in 1999), and premiered (out of competition)\n        on the 2005 Cannes Festival May 15. The film was generally positively\n        received by critics, especially in comparison to the two previous\n        prequels. It broke several box office records in its opening week and\n        went on to earn over US $800 million worldwide, making it one of the\n        top-grossing movies of 2005. It is the second Star Wars film which used\n        a high-definition digital 24 frame system for most of the movie's\n        live-action scenes. The film was re-released in the Blu-ray format in\n        September of 2011. On November 12, 2019, the film was included with the\n        launch of Disney+.

Publisher summary Experience Star Wars:\n        Episode IV A New Hope like never before! Fully illustrated with gorgeous\n        images by Star Wars artist Brian Rood, this epic storybook also includes\n        a CD with word-for-word narration, music, and character voices. Follow\n        along as Luke Skywalker meets Obi-Wan Kenobi, rescues Princess Leia, and\n        faces Darth Vader for the first time. Plot summary In a galaxy torn by\n        conflict, a vessel carrying secret plans for the Galactic Empire's\n        ultimate weapon, the Death Star, races towards Tatooine. It is\n        intercepted by the Devastator, an Imperial-class Star Destroyer, but\n        before the Empire's agents have time to the search the ship, the\n        Princess Leia Organa hides the plans in the memory banks of the droid\n        R2-D2 and sends him and his companion, C-3PO, in an escape pod to\n        Tatooine. Leia Organa is captured by the feared agent of the Empire, the\n        Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Vader, but refuses to provide him with any\n        information. Being that she is an Imperial Senator, he declares her a\n        traitor to the Empire and orders her taken away for questioning. On the\n        planet Tatooine, the droids find themselves captured by Jawa scavengers.\n        They are then sold to the moisture farmer Owen Lars, who tells his\n        nephew, Luke Skywalker, to clean them up so that they can be of service\n        on the Lars moisture farm. While examining the droids, Luke accidentally\n        activates a portion of a secret message programmed in the R2 series\n        astromech droid, R2-D2. The holographic message depicts the woman from\n        the Tantive IV, Leia Organa, stating \"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my\n        only hope.\" Skywalker is dazzled by the image of the beautiful woman. He\n        isn't sure who \"Obi-Wan Kenobi\" is, but does know of an old Ben Kenobi,\n        a sort of strange old hermit who lives out beyond the Dune Sea. Fearing\n        that the droids may have been stolen, Luke sets off in a landspeeder to\n        pay a visit to Ben Kenobi. Upon arrival, Kenobi is able to access the\n        full message stored within R2's databanks, which is a message from Leia\n        Organa appealing to Kenobi in the name of his service during the Clone\n        Wars, asking him to deliver the droids to Alderaan, as the R2 unit\n        contains information vital to the continued survival of the Rebel\n        Alliance. At this point, Kenobi informs Skywalker that he was once a\n        Jedi Knight, as Skywalker's father was. Skywalker is surprised, as he\n        didn't know his father was ever a Jedi. Kenobi gives Skywalker his\n        father's lightsaber and tells him that he must learn the ways of the\n        Force if he's to come with him to Alderaan. Skywalker, not ready to give\n        up his life on Tatooine, tells him that he can only take him as far as\n        Anchorhead. Kenobi grimly replies that he must do what he feels is\n        right. While traveling to Anchorhead, the group discovers that the Jawa\n        sandcrawler with had previously borne R2-D2 and C-3PO had been destroyed\n        by Imperial forces. Skywalker realizes that this means the Imperials\n        would have tracked the trail back to the Lars homestead, but it's too\n        late, and the entire property has been destroyed. Turning to Kenobi, he\n        tells him that he wants to join him on his mission to Alderaan. The two\n        travel to Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina, where they meet with Han Solo of\n        the Millennium Falcon and his Wookiee co-pilot, Chewbacca. They make a\n        deal to travel on Solo's ship to travel to Alderaan and while they head\n        off to sell their landspeeder for some extra money, Solo has a\n        discussion with Jabba, a vicious Hutt that he owes money too. The two\n        come to an agreement that Solo can pay him after completing this next\n        charter, but if he fails again, then Jabba will bring down an army of\n        bounty hunters upon him. As the Millennium Falcon departs for Alderaan,\n        an unpleasant scene unfolds upon the Death Star. Princess Leia Organa is\n        brought before the station's commander, Wilhuff Tarkin, who tells her\n        that before her execution, he'd like her to witness \"a ceremony that\n        will make this battle station fully operational.\" The full force and\n        power of the station's feared weapon, the superlaser, is then brought to\n        bear on Alderaan, completely obliterating Organa's home planet. At the\n        same time, the Millennium Falcon emerges from hyperspace, only for the\n        crew to find that the planet they're trying to reach apparently isn't\n        there, only a \"small moon.\" Obi-Wan Kenobi, however, realizes \"That's no\n        moon. That's a space station.\" The ship is quickly caught in a tractor\n        beam from said space station and pulled in. When Imperial forces search\n        the ship, however, they find it empty, as everyone has hidden in secret\n        compartments. Once the Imperial forces leave, the group emerges and\n        sneaks on-board the Death Star. Obi-Wan Kenobi sets off to disable the\n        tractor beam and as he does so, the droid R2-D2 plugs into an Imperial\n        computer and discovers that Leia Organa is aboard the station. Skywalker\n        convinces Solo and Chewbacca to join him on a rescue mission to save the\n        princess. He and Solo disguise themselves as Imperial stormtroopers that\n        are escorting their prisoner, Chewbacca. The ruse works and Skywalker\n        discovers the Princess's cell. He informs her of who he is and that he's\n        come to rescue her. The group beats a hasty retreat as stormtroopers\n        bear down, but it soon becomes clear that they have no real plan of\n        escape. Organa, unimpressed, decides to create her own plan and directs\n        the group to take refuge down a garbage chute. The group lands safely on\n        a pile of smelly garbage, but then finds the walls closing in on them.\n        They've landed in a garbage masher. They are very nearly crushed, but\n        Luke Skywalker suddenly remembers the droids and pages R2-D2 on his\n        comlink, getting him to shut the garbage masher down. While all of this\n        happens, Ben Kenobi finds the controls for the tractor beam and disables\n        it. On his way back to the Millennium Falcon, however, he encounters\n        Darth Vader, his former student who has now turned to the dark side of\n        the Force. As the two engage in a fierce duel, Skywalker and the others\n        make for the Millennium Falcon, but Skywalker is shocked when Kenobi\n        seems to simply stop fighting in the middle of the duel, his robes\n        collapsing in a crumpled heap as Vader swings through them. Skywalker is\n        horrified by what he is just witnessed, but there is no time for\n        mourning as he and the others escape the Death Star. Before making the\n        leap to hyperspace, the crew fights off four Imperial TIE/ln space\n        superiority starfighters. They arrive safely at the Rebel base on Yavin\n        4, but have no time to celebrate, as the Empire placed a homing beacon\n        on the Millennium Falcon, leading them directly to the Rebels. With the\n        secret plans in their possession, however, the Rebels are able to put\n        together a plan-of-action and launch their X-wing starfighters against\n        the Empire's forces, which even include a TIE fighter flown by Darth\n        Vader himself. In a fierce and challenging battle, after one of the\n        rebel pilots fails to hit the Death Star's weak spot, everything is up\n        to Luke Skywalker, whom Vader has right on his tail. Noting \"The Force\n        is strong is strong with this one,\" Vader prepares to fire, only for a\n        laser blast to impact the vessel of his wingman, sending his own ship\n        careening off into space. Solo comms that Skywalker is clear and as\n        Skywalker makes his run, he hears the voice of Ben Kenobi telling him to\n        \"use the Force.\" He fires two proton torpedos, landing a direct hit that\n        causes the Death Star to explode. Back on Yavin, everyone gathers to\n        celebrate this great victory over the Empire. Both Han Solo and Luke\n        Skywalker are awarded Medals of Bravery by Leia Organa, but though\n        everyone is happy for their victory, they know that the Empire, Darth\n        Vader and the feared Galactic Emperor remain a grave threat.[4]\n        Omissions and modifications A New Hope Read-Along Storybook and CD is a\n        picture book and audio retelling of the events of Star Wars: Episode IV\n        A New Hope, but omits a number of details and scenes to fit the story\n        within the format of a 32-page picture book. The opening scene aboard\n        the Tantive IV is presented largely as it is in the film, simply\n        omitting certain dialogue unnecessary to the story. The story then skips\n        ahead to C-3PO and R2-D2 being captured by the Jawa scavengers, the\n        details of the journey through the desert omitted. Luke Skywalker's\n        story begins with him visiting the Jawas to purchase the droids with\n        Owen Lars, though Owen himself is not pictured. R5-D4 appears only in\n        the book's illustration. The story continues with Luke examining the\n        droids in the garage, omitting all material with Luke speaking with his\n        aunt and uncle and the character of Beru Whitesun Lars entirely. R2-D2\n        is shown playing back the message from Leia Organa, but there is no\n        mention of Luke attempting to remove a restraining bolt from him, nor\n        having placed it in the first place. Rather than R2-D2 escaping into the\n        Jundland Wastes, it is instead suggested that Luke boards his\n        landspeeder directly with both droids and proceeds directly to deliver\n        them to Obi-Wan Kenobi, fearing that they had been stolen. As such, all\n        scenes involving the Tusken Raiders and the danger in the desert are\n        omitted. Upon arrival, Kenobi discovers the full message from Organa\n        immediately and only tells Luke Skywalker of his history as a Jedi and\n        offers him his father's lightsaber after the message has been played,\n        though he does not tell Luke that Darth Vader killed his father. The\n        scene following, in which those on the Death Star receive news of the\n        dissolution of the Imperial Senate and in which Vader chokes Admiral\n        Conan Antonio Motti, is omitted entirely. The story continues with\n        Skywalker and Kenobi finding the Lars homestead destroyed and traveling\n        to Mos Eisley, though they are not shown encountering the stormtroopers,\n        nor does Skywalker get into trouble in the Mos Eisley Cantina. Han Solo\n        is not shown having to fend off Greedo, thus skirting the question of\n        who shot first, though he is shown talking with Jabba the Hutt and\n        promising him that he now has a \"nice easy charter\" and will be able to\n        pay him back. On the Death Star, Leia Organa is taken before Wilhuff\n        Tarkin, but there is never any mention of her being tortured for\n        information and while Alderaan is destroyed, it seems to be done simply\n        out of spite and to horrify Organa. The story then arrives at the\n        Millennium Falcon emerging from hyperspace, with Skywalker's training\n        with Ben Kenobi and the game of dejarik between R2-D2 and Chewbacca\n        depicted only the book's front cover. The arrival at the Death Star and\n        hiding then boarding is largely the same as in the film, though no\n        reference is made to Vader detecting a familiar presence. Luke's\n        persuasion of Solo is only briefly described and no mention is made of\n        the droids being left behind during the rescue of Princess Leia, nor of\n        the difficulties the group encounters prior to them actually escaping\n        with the princess. Though the garbage compactor scene is depicted, the\n        living creature within it is not mentioned. The remainder of the events\n        of the escape from the Death Star are highly compressed, with the group\n        described as simply escaping from the garbage masher and then arriving\n        at the docking bay, where they witness the battle between Darth Vader\n        and Obi-Wan Kenobi. This is described generally as it occurs in the\n        film, with the Millennium Falcon's escape and battle with TIE fighters\n        described in a couple of brief sentences. Following the Millennium\n        Falcon's arrival at the Rebel base, all scenes involving the discussion\n        of how to take down the Death Star and Luke Skywalker meeting up with\n        Biggs Darklighter are omitted. Additionally, no mention is made of Han\n        Solo choosing to leave with Chewbacca in order to pay his debt to Jabba.\n        The story instead proceeds immediately to the Rebel Alliance's assault\n        against the Death Star. This is described in a few brief paragraphs with\n        no mention of Wedge Antilles, nor by name of any Rebel pilot other than\n        Skywalker. None of the scenes during the battle on the Death Star itself\n        are depicted. Following the battle, the story ends with a depiction of\n        Skywalker and Solo being presented with medals of valor. Episode V: The\n        Empire Strikes Back Read-Along Storybook and CD is a young readers'\n        story from Disney–Lucasfilm Press, that was released on March 10, 2015.\n        It presents an illustrated version of the story of Star Wars: Episode V\n        The Empire Strikes Back and also features an accompanying CD with\n        narration of the story and character voices. Publisher summary The\n        Rebellion faces its darkest hour in Star Wars: Episode V The Empire\n        Strikes Back. Fully illustrated with gorgeous images by Star Wars artist\n        Brian Rood, this epic storybook also includes a CD with word-for-word\n        narration, music, and character voices. Follow along as Luke Skywalker\n        trains with Yoda to become a Jedi and defeat the fearsome Darth Vader.\n        Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, marketed as simply Return of\n        the Jedi, is a 1983 film directed by Richard Marquand and written by\n        Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas from a story by Lucas. It is the third\n        and final part of the Star Wars original trilogy. Luke Skywalker and\n        friends travel to Tatooine to rescue their companion Han Solo from the\n        vile Jabba the Hutt. The Empire prepares to crush the Rebellion with a\n        more powerful Death Star, while the Rebel fleet mounts a massive attack\n        on the space station. Luke confronts his father, Anakin Skywalker, in a\n        final climactic duel before the evil Emperor Sidious. The film debuted\n        on May 25, 1983, and was released on VHS and LaserDisc in this form\n        multiple times during the 80s and 90s. The film was re-released with\n        changes in 1997, and this version was later released on VHS and\n        LaserDisc as well. The special edition arrived on DVD in 2004, but with\n        further updates and changes to the 1997 versions. The original,\n        unaltered version of the film was released as part of a DVD set in\n        September 2006. The film was re-released in the Blu-ray format in\n        September of 2011. Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, marketed as\n        Star Wars: The Force Awakens, is a 2015 film directed by J.J. Abrams;\n        co-written by Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan, and Michael Arndt; and produced\n        by Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy and Bad Robot Productions. It is\n        the first part of the Star Wars sequel trilogy. The film stars Harrison\n        Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Anthony Daniels, and Peter Mayhew\n        reprising their original roles. The original actors are joined by a host\n        of new actors including Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, and\n        Oscar Isaac. The story begins thirty years after the events of Star\n        Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. The First Order has risen from the\n        ashes of the Galactic Empire and is opposed by General Leia Organa and\n        the Resistance, both of which seek to find the missing Jedi Master Luke\n        Skywalker. In the midst of this search, new heroes rise in the form of\n        Rey, a 19 year-old girl and a Force-sensitive scavenger from Jakku;\n        Finn, a stormtrooper who defected from the First Order; and Poe Dameron,\n        the best pilot in the Resistance. They are aided by Han Solo in their\n        search for Skywalker and their mission to destroy the First Order's new\n        superweapon, Starkiller Base, which targets the New Republic and the\n        Resistance for destruction. They are opposed by villains such as Kylo\n        Ren, a dark warrior with a mysterious past; and General Armitage Hux,\n        the commander of Starkiller Base. Despite initially claiming that the\n        Star Wars story ended with the redemption of Anakin Skywalker in Return\n        of the Jedi, and after spending years refuting speculation that there\n        would be another film, Star Wars creator George Lucas began work on\n        Episode VII in 2011 in order to increase the value of Lucasfilm before\n        he sold it to The Walt Disney Company, although Disney would later elect\n        to not use Lucas' story. The acquisition was finalized on October 30,\n        2012. Disney and Lucasfilm officially announced Episode VII and the\n        sequel trilogy the same day. Lucasfilm later announced that the film\n        would be an original story not beholden to the continuity of the Star\n        Wars Expanded Universe, which was rebranded as the non-canon Star Wars\n        Legends. The Force Awakens was released on December 17, 2015 in the\n        United Kingdom, Mexico, Latin America, and Asian countries; December 18,\n        2015 in North America; and January 9, 2016 in China. Some North American\n        theaters offered special limited advance showings on the evening of\n        December 17th rather than the traditional midnight showing. The film\n        received widespread critical praise upon its release and was a massive\n        box office success, becoming the highest grossing film of all time in\n        North America when not adjusted for inflation. Worldwide, the film was\n        the third highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release\n        (behind Avatar and Titanic). It is currently the fourth highest-grossing\n        film of all time (behind Avengers: Endgame, Avatar and Titanic). Star\n        Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, marketed as Star Wars: The Last Jedi,\n        is a 2017 film written and directed by Rian Johnson and produced by\n        Kathleen Kennedy and Ram Bergman, along with executive producer J.J.\n        Abrams. It is the second part of the Star Wars sequel trilogy. The film\n        sees the return of Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy\n        Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong'o, Domhnall Gleeson,\n        Anthony Daniels, Gwendoline Christie, and Andy Serkis. New cast members\n        include Benicio Del Toro, Laura Dern, and Kelly Marie Tran. The Last\n        Jedi begins immediately after the events of Star Wars: Episode VII The\n        Force Awakens, set thirty years after the conclusion of the original\n        Star Wars trilogy. It continues the story of Rey and her discovery of\n        the exiled Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, along with the story of the war\n        between General Leia Organa's Resistance and the First Order. The film\n        was released on December 14, 2017 in Hong Kong, Mexico, Latin America,\n        and European countries; December 15, 2017 in North America; and January\n        5, 2018 in China. Some North American theaters offered special limited\n        advance showings on the evening of December 14th rather than the\n        traditional midnight showing. The Last Jedi garnered four nominations at\n        the 90th Academy Awards, including Best Original Score and Best Visual\n        Effects. The following and final installment of the sequel trilogy, Star\n        Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, was released on December 20,\n        2019. Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, marketed as Star\n        Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, is a 2019 film directed by J.J. Abrams from\n        a script by Abrams and Chris Terrio. It is the third and final part of\n        the Star Wars sequel trilogy. The film, produced by Lucasfilm president\n        Kathleen Kennedy, is a continuation of 2015's The Force Awakens, which\n        Abrams also directed and co-wrote, and 2017's The Last Jedi. Lucasfilm\n        has referred to The Rise of Skywalker as the eleventh and final\n        installment of the Skywalker saga. The film stars Carrie Fisher, Mark\n        Hamill, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Anthony\n        Daniels, Naomi Ackie, Domhnall Gleeson, Richard E. Grant, Lupita\n        Nyong'o, Keri Russell, Joonas Suotamo, Kelly Marie Tran, with Ian\n        McDiarmid and Billy Dee Williams. Fisher, who passed away in 2016 prior\n        to the film's production, appeared via unused footage from The Force\n        Awakens. The film was first announced after The Walt Disney Company\n        acquired Lucasfilm Ltd. in 2012. Colin Trevorrow was initially announced\n        as the director and writer of the film, but he and Lucasfilm parted ways\n        in September 2017, with Lucasfilm citing \"creative differences\" over the\n        project. On September 12, 2017, Abrams and Terrio were announced as the\n        new director and writers. Principal photography began in 2018, and\n        filming wrapped in 2019. Footage from The Rise of Skywalker was first\n        made public on April 12, 2019 at Celebration Chicago. The film was\n        released on December 20, 2019. It received mixed reviews from critics.\n        The Rise of Skywalker received three nominations at the 92nd Academy\n        Awards: Best Original Score, Best Visual Effects, and Best Sound\n        Editing. It has grossed over $1 billion worldwide, making it the\n        forty-sixth highest-grossing film of all time. Episode XXIV: Death on\n        the Rim was the twenty-fourth instalment of the historical holodrama\n        series True Tales of the Ancient Republic. It was released in 114 BBY.\n        Set during the Kymoodon Era, it followed the exploits of the Sector\n        Ranger Novan Nune, who fought to rescue the colonists of Parcovey Minor\n        after they were kidnapped and enslaved by a Hutt kajidic. Considered a\n        popular and entertaining holofilm, Death on the Rim was still being\n        studied by academics of popular entertainment as late as 6 ABY.\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  name: 'SWCrawlText',\n  computed: {\n    isDark() {\n      return this.$vuetify.theme.dark\n    },\n    color() {\n      const color = this.isDark\n        ?
