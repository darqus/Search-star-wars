know it.\nGrowing up on the desert world Tatooine, Anakin Skywalker never thought\nhe would venture beyond the small life he has. Simple, boyhood pursuits\nseem like the only things he should be concerned with. But destiny has\nother things in mind... Plot summary On the galactic frontier of the\nOuter Rim, the planet Tatooine orbits the inner edge of the twin suns\nTatoo I and Tatoo II. A clan of Jawas loots a crashed starship while a\nband of Tusken Raiders watches on from the cliffs overhead. As one\nobserves the Jawas through a pair of electrobinoculars, two Tuskens pore\nover a poster advertising the Boonta Eve Classic podrace. The Tuskens\nmount their banthas and follow the Jawa procession towards the spaceport\nsettlement of Mos Espa. There, in the junkyard owned by the Toydarian\njunk dealer Watto, the slave boy Anakin Skywalker works under a large\nbin with a fusioncutter, and is watched keenly by a womp rat. The\ncritter dashes into a tripwire, springing a trap and causing Anakin to\nbump his head in the commotion. He's met by Amee, who notices the\nensnared womp rat. Anakin cuts it free, stating that all living things\nshould be free, and continues to search for parts for his secret\npodracer. The pair spot a herd of banthas, unusually close to the\nsettlement, which Anakin suggests is because a storm is coming.\nAttempting to return to the shop before he can be yelled at by Watto,\nAnakin again encounters the womp rat, which sits on a gleaming energy\nbinder. Surprised, Anakin inspects the device, having usually been able\nto know where to find things in Watto's junkyard. Anakin's inspection is\ninterrupted by Watto, whose yelling in Huttese brings the boy and Amee\ninside the shop. He tasks Anakin with obtaining a thermal veristat and\nThruster relays from the visiting Jawas, and admonishes Anakin for\ndestroying his podracer in the boy's last race. Watto threatens to beat\nAnakin blind, to which the boy quips that he would not be able to race\nif he was blind. Watto points out that he doesn't have a podracer to fly\nanyway, and sends Anakin away. The boy meets his mother, Shmi Skywalker,\nwho asks him to buy fruit from Jira on his way. He asks her to hide his\nnew energy binder, and sets off for the plaza. Wandering through the\ncrowds, Anakin is accosted by his friends Kitster and Wald, the latter\nof whom has acquired a peggat Kitster hopes to spend on a ruby bliel.\nThe boys stop off at Jira's stall, and learn her cooling unit has broken\ndown. She gives Anakin some pika fruits for his mother, and Anakin\npromises to find a replacement unit in the junkyard. They head for Maggy\nthe Gorgon's, but happen upon Sebulba the Dug in the street, admonishing\nhis band over his entrance music for the podrace. Sebulba mocks Anakin\nabout his crash in their last race, and Anakin accuses his rival of\ncheating and killing fellow racer Rimkar. The two square off, and are\nabout to scuffle when a cantina patron is knocked through the doorway of\nMaggy's, interrupting the pair. An old spacer and previous acquaintance\nof Anakin's sees Sebulba off, and warns the slave boys not to go into\nMaggy's today, instead giving them a ruby bliel to share. Anakin asks\nthe retired pilot to tell him about the Angels of Iego again when he\ncomes back. Anakin vows that one day he'll become a deep-space pilot and\nwalk on all the planets. As Anakin catches up with his friends, a Duros\nasks the spacer why he bothers talking to the slave, to which the old\nhuman replies that there is something about Anakin. The pair laugh it\noff and return inside Maggy's, where the Xexto podracer Gasgano is in\nthe midst of a violent bar brawl. Forcing his opponents to exclaim the\nvirtues of his Ord Pedrovia podracer, Gasgano is bitten by a Gran.\nMeanwhile, Aldar Beedo and Wan Sandage negotiate a deal to eliminate\nSebulba from the race, while Ark Roose watches Skywalker from the\nwindow, plotting his revenge against the boy. Unbeknownst, Anakin and\nhis friends find the Jawa traders, but only in time to watch a pit droid\nbuying exactly the parts Skywalker is looking for. Back at the shop,\nWatto is furious with Anakin, and makes him clean the bins again. Anakin\ngives his mother the fruit from Jira, and Shmi takes a moment to look at\nher son, momentarily fearing that she might not see him again. Seeing\nhim off, Shmi warns Anakin of the approaching storm. In the junkyard,\nAnakin again discovers the womp rat he saved, now standing on a cooling\nunit. Anakin sits on top of it happily, and stares up at the sky in time\nto spot a ship coming in a high speed. Anakin wonders if it was an\nAngel, and dreams of one leading warriors into battle on planets without\nnumber. He sees himself as a Jedi, holding a glowing lightsaber as\nchained hands reach out to him imploringly. However, he is stirred from\nhis vision by Watto's voice, and arrives at the shop in time to find the\nToydarian has visitors: Qui-Gon Jinn, Jar Jar Binks, R2-D2, and the\nbeautiful young Padmé Naberrie, whom Skywalker thinks of as the Angel of\nhis dreams. Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones is a 2002 film\ndirected by George Lucas and written by Lucas and Jonathan Hales. It is\nthe second part of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. The film is set nine\nyears after the Battle of Naboo, when the galaxy is on the brink of\ncivil war. Under the leadership of renegade Jedi Master Count Dooku,\nthousands of systems threaten to secede from the Republic. When an\nassassination attempt is made on Senator Padmé Amidala, the former Queen\nof Naboo, Jedi apprentice Anakin Skywalker is assigned to protect her,\nwhile his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi is assigned to investigate the\nassassination attempt. Soon the Jedi are drawn into the heart of the\nSeparatist movement, and the beginning of a new threat to the galaxy:\nthe Clone Wars. Attack of the Clones was the first Star Wars film to use\na high-definition digital 24-frame system for most of the its\nlive-action scenes. The film was a financial success, grossing over $600\nmillion at the worldwide box office. However, for the first time, a Star\nWars film did not earn the highest box-office sales for the year; Attack\nof the Clones ended up fourth behind The Lord of the Rings: The Two\nTowers, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, and Spider-Man. Star\nWars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith is a 2005 film written and\ndirected by George Lucas. It is the third and final part of the Star\nWars prequel trilogy. Three years after the First Battle of Geonosis and\nonset of the Clone Wars, the noble Jedi Knights have been leading a\nmassive clone army into a galaxy-wide battle against the Confederacy of\nIndependent Systems. The Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic\nreveals his true nature as a Sith Lord as he unveils a plot to rule the\ngalaxy by transforming the Republic into a Galactic Empire. Jedi hero\nAnakin Skywalker is seduced by the dark side of the Force to become\nDarth Sidious's new apprentice Darth Vader. The Jedi are all but\neliminated with Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Master Yoda forced into hiding.\nThe only hope for the galaxy is Anakin's own offspring—the twin children\nborn in secrecy who will grow up to become Luke Skywalker and Leia\nOrgana. Revenge of the Sith was released in theaters on Thursday, May\n19, 2005 (the same day that the first episode of the prequel trilogy The\nPhantom Menace was released in 1999), and premiered (out of competition)\non the 2005 Cannes Festival May 15. The film was generally positively\nreceived by critics, especially in comparison to the two previous\nprequels. It broke several box office records in its opening week and\nwent on to earn over US $800 million worldwide, making it one of the\ntop-grossing movies of 2005. It is the second Star Wars film which used\na high-definition digital 24 frame system for most of the movie's\nlive-action scenes. The film was re-released in the Blu-ray format in\nSeptember of 2011. On November 12, 2019, the film was included with the\nlaunch of Disney+.

Publisher summary Experience Star Wars:\nEpisode IV A New Hope like never before! Fully illustrated with gorgeous\nimages by Star Wars artist Brian Rood, this epic storybook also includes\na CD with word-for-word narration, music, and character voices. Follow\nalong as Luke Skywalker meets Obi-Wan Kenobi, rescues Princess Leia, and\nfaces Darth Vader for the first time. Plot summary In a galaxy torn by\nconflict, a vessel carrying secret plans for the Galactic Empire's\nultimate weapon, the Death Star, races towards Tatooine. It is\nintercepted by the Devastator, an Imperial-class Star Destroyer, but\nbefore the Empire's agents have time to the search the ship, the\nPrincess Leia Organa hides the plans in the memory banks of the droid\nR2-D2 and sends him and his companion, C-3PO, in an escape pod to\nTatooine. Leia Organa is captured by the feared agent of the Empire, the\nDark Lord of the Sith, Darth Vader, but refuses to provide him with any\ninformation. Being that she is an Imperial Senator, he declares her a\ntraitor to the Empire and orders her taken away for questioning. On the\nplanet Tatooine, the droids find themselves captured by Jawa scavengers.\nThey are then sold to the moisture farmer Owen Lars, who tells his\nnephew, Luke Skywalker, to clean them up so that they can be of service\non the Lars moisture farm. While examining the droids, Luke accidentally\nactivates a portion of a secret message programmed in the R2 series\nastromech droid, R2-D2. The holographic message depicts the woman from\nthe Tantive IV, Leia Organa, stating \"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my\nonly hope.\" Skywalker is dazzled by the image of the beautiful woman. He\nisn't sure who \"Obi-Wan Kenobi\" is, but does know of an old Ben Kenobi,\na sort of strange old hermit who lives out beyond the Dune Sea. Fearing\nthat the droids may have been stolen, Luke sets off in a landspeeder to\npay a visit to Ben Kenobi. Upon arrival, Kenobi is able to access the\nfull message stored within R2's databanks, which is a message from Leia\nOrgana appealing to Kenobi in the name of his service during the Clone\nWars, asking him to deliver the droids to Alderaan, as the R2 unit\ncontains information vital to the continued survival of the Rebel\nAlliance. At this point, Kenobi informs Skywalker that he was once a\nJedi Knight, as Skywalker's father was. Skywalker is surprised, as he\ndidn't know his father was ever a Jedi. Kenobi gives Skywalker his\nfather's lightsaber and tells him that he must learn the ways of the\nForce if he's to come with him to Alderaan. Skywalker, not ready to give\nup his life on Tatooine, tells him that he can only take him as far as\nAnchorhead. Kenobi grimly replies that he must do what he feels is\nright. While traveling to Anchorhead, the group discovers that the Jawa\nsandcrawler with had previously borne R2-D2 and C-3PO had been destroyed\nby Imperial forces. Skywalker realizes that this means the Imperials\nwould have tracked the trail back to the Lars homestead, but it's too\nlate, and the entire property has been destroyed. Turning to Kenobi, he\ntells him that he wants to join him on his mission to Alderaan. The two\ntravel to Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina, where they meet with Han Solo of\nthe Millennium Falcon and his Wookiee co-pilot, Chewbacca. They make a\ndeal to travel on Solo's ship to travel to Alderaan and while they head\noff to sell their landspeeder for some extra money, Solo has a\ndiscussion with Jabba, a vicious Hutt that he owes money too. The two\ncome to an agreement that Solo can pay him after completing this next\ncharter, but if he fails again, then Jabba will bring down an army of\nbounty hunters upon him. As the Millennium Falcon departs for Alderaan,\nan unpleasant scene unfolds upon the Death Star. Princess Leia Organa is\nbrought before the station's commander, Wilhuff Tarkin, who tells her\nthat before her execution, he'd like her to witness \"a ceremony that\nwill make this battle station fully operational.\" The full force and\npower of the station's feared weapon, the superlaser, is then brought to\nbear on Alderaan, completely obliterating Organa's home planet. At the\nsame time, the Millennium Falcon emerges from hyperspace, only for the\ncrew to find that the planet they're trying to reach apparently isn't\nthere, only a \"small moon.\" Obi-Wan Kenobi, however, realizes \"That's no\nmoon. That's a space station.\" The ship is quickly caught in a tractor\nbeam from said space station and pulled in. When Imperial forces search\nthe ship, however, they find it empty, as everyone has hidden in secret\ncompartments. Once the Imperial forces leave, the group emerges and\nsneaks on-board the Death Star. Obi-Wan Kenobi sets off to disable the\ntractor beam and as he does so, the droid R2-D2 plugs into an Imperial\ncomputer and discovers that Leia Organa is aboard the station. Skywalker\nconvinces Solo and Chewbacca to join him on a rescue mission to save the\nprincess. He and Solo disguise themselves as Imperial stormtroopers that\nare escorting their prisoner, Chewbacca. The ruse works and Skywalker\ndiscovers the Princess's cell. He informs her of who he is and that he's\ncome to rescue her. The group beats a hasty retreat as stormtroopers\nbear down, but it soon becomes clear that they have no real plan of\nescape. Organa, unimpressed, decides to create her own plan and directs\nthe group to take refuge down a garbage chute. The group lands safely on\na pile of smelly garbage, but then finds the walls closing in on them.\nThey've landed in a garbage masher. They are very nearly crushed, but\nLuke Skywalker suddenly remembers the droids and pages R2-D2 on his\ncomlink, getting him to shut the garbage masher down. While all of this\nhappens, Ben Kenobi finds the controls for the tractor beam and disables\nit. On his way back to the Millennium Falcon, however, he encounters\nDarth Vader, his former student who has now turned to the dark side of\nthe Force. As the two engage in a fierce duel, Skywalker and the others\nmake for the Millennium Falcon, but Skywalker is shocked when Kenobi\nseems to simply stop fighting in the middle of the duel, his robes\ncollapsing in a crumpled heap as Vader swings through them. Skywalker is\nhorrified by what he is just witnessed, but there is no time for\nmourning as he and the others escape the Death Star. Before making the\nleap to hyperspace, the crew fights off four Imperial TIE/ln space\nsuperiority starfighters. They arrive safely at the Rebel base on Yavin\n4, but have no time to celebrate, as the Empire placed a homing beacon\non the Millennium Falcon, leading them directly to the Rebels. With the\nsecret plans in their possession, however, the Rebels are able to put\ntogether a plan-of-action and launch their X-wing starfighters against\nthe Empire's forces, which even include a TIE fighter flown by Darth\nVader himself. In a fierce and challenging battle, after one of the\nrebel pilots fails to hit the Death Star's weak spot, everything is up\nto Luke Skywalker, whom Vader has right on his tail. Noting \"The Force\nis strong is strong with this one,\" Vader prepares to fire, only for a\nlaser blast to impact the vessel of his wingman, sending his own ship\ncareening off into space. Solo comms that Skywalker is clear and as\nSkywalker makes his run, he hears the voice of Ben Kenobi telling him to\n\"use the Force.\" He fires two proton torpedos, landing a direct hit that\ncauses the Death Star to explode. Back on Yavin, everyone gathers to\ncelebrate this great victory over the Empire. Both Han Solo and Luke\nSkywalker are awarded Medals of Bravery by Leia Organa, but though\neveryone is happy for their victory, they know that the Empire, Darth\nVader and the feared Galactic Emperor remain a grave threat.[4]\nOmissions and modifications A New Hope Read-Along Storybook and CD is a\npicture book and audio retelling of the events of Star Wars: Episode IV\nA New Hope, but omits a number of details and scenes to fit the story\nwithin the format of a 32-page picture book. The opening scene aboard\nthe Tantive IV is presented largely as it is in the film, simply\nomitting certain dialogue unnecessary to the story. The story then skips\nahead to C-3PO and R2-D2 being captured by the Jawa scavengers, the\ndetails of the journey through the desert omitted. Luke Skywalker's\nstory begins with him visiting the Jawas to purchase the droids with\nOwen Lars, though Owen himself is not pictured. R5-D4 appears only in\nthe book's illustration. The story continues with Luke examining the\ndroids in the garage, omitting all material with Luke speaking with his\naunt and uncle and the character of Beru Whitesun Lars entirely. R2-D2\nis shown playing back the message from Leia Organa, but there is no\nmention of Luke attempting to remove a restraining bolt from him, nor\nhaving placed it in the first place. Rather than R2-D2 escaping into the\nJundland Wastes, it is instead suggested that Luke boards his\nlandspeeder directly with both droids and proceeds directly to deliver\nthem to Obi-Wan Kenobi, fearing that they had been stolen. As such, all\nscenes involving the Tusken Raiders and the danger in the desert are\nomitted. Upon arrival, Kenobi discovers the full message from Organa\nimmediately and only tells Luke Skywalker of his history as a Jedi and\noffers him his father's lightsaber after the message has been played,\nthough he does not tell Luke that Darth Vader killed his father. The\nscene following, in which those on the Death Star receive news of the\ndissolution of the Imperial Senate and in which Vader chokes Admiral\nConan Antonio Motti, is omitted entirely. The story continues with\nSkywalker and Kenobi finding the Lars homestead destroyed and traveling\nto Mos Eisley, though they are not shown encountering the stormtroopers,\nnor does Skywalker get into trouble in the Mos Eisley Cantina. Han Solo\nis not shown having to fend off Greedo, thus skirting the question of\nwho shot first, though he is shown talking with Jabba the Hutt and\npromising him that he now has a \"nice easy charter\" and will be able to\npay him back. On the Death Star, Leia Organa is taken before Wilhuff\nTarkin, but there is never any mention of her being tortured for\ninformation and while Alderaan is destroyed, it seems to be done simply\nout of spite and to horrify Organa. The story then arrives at the\nMillennium Falcon emerging from hyperspace, with Skywalker's training\nwith Ben Kenobi and the game of dejarik between R2-D2 and Chewbacca\ndepicted only the book's front cover. The arrival at the Death Star and\nhiding then boarding is largely the same as in the film, though no\nreference is made to Vader detecting a familiar presence. Luke's\npersuasion of Solo is only briefly described and no mention is made of\nthe droids being left behind during the rescue of Princess Leia, nor of\nthe difficulties the group encounters prior to them actually escaping\nwith the princess. Though the garbage compactor scene is depicted, the\nliving creature within it is not mentioned. The remainder of the events\nof the escape from the Death Star are highly compressed, with the group\ndescribed as simply escaping from the garbage masher and then arriving\nat the docking bay, where they witness the battle between Darth Vader\nand Obi-Wan Kenobi. This is described generally as it occurs in the\nfilm, with the Millennium Falcon's escape and battle with TIE fighters\ndescribed in a couple of brief sentences. Following the Millennium\nFalcon's arrival at the Rebel base, all scenes involving the discussion\nof how to take down the Death Star and Luke Skywalker meeting up with\nBiggs Darklighter are omitted. Additionally, no mention is made of Han\nSolo choosing to leave with Chewbacca in order to pay his debt to Jabba.\nThe story instead proceeds immediately to the Rebel Alliance's assault\nagainst the Death Star. This is described in a few brief paragraphs with\nno mention of Wedge Antilles, nor by name of any Rebel pilot other than\nSkywalker. None of the scenes during the battle on the Death Star itself\nare depicted. Following the battle, the story ends with a depiction of\nSkywalker and Solo being presented with medals of valor.

Luke confronts his father, Anakin Skywalker, in a\nfinal climactic duel before the evil Emperor Sidious. The film debuted\non May 25, 1983, and was released on VHS and LaserDisc in this form\nmultiple times during the 80s and 90s. The film was re-released with\nchanges in 1997, and this version was later released on VHS and\nLaserDisc as well. The special edition arrived on DVD in 2004, but with\nfurther updates and changes to the 1997 versions. The original,\nunaltered version of the film was released as part of a DVD set in\nSeptember 2006. The film was re-released in the Blu-ray format in\nSeptember of 2011. Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, marketed as\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens, is a 2015 film directed by J.J. Abrams;\nco-written by Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan, and Michael Arndt; and produced\nby Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy and Bad Robot Productions. It is\nthe first part of the Star Wars sequel trilogy. The film stars Harrison\nFord, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Anthony Daniels, and Peter Mayhew\nreprising their original roles. The original actors are joined by a host\nof new actors including Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, and\nOscar Isaac. The story begins thirty years after the events of Star\nWars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. The First Order has risen from the\nashes of the Galactic Empire and is opposed by General Leia Organa and\nthe Resistance, both of which seek to find the missing Jedi Master Luke\nSkywalker. In the midst of this search, new heroes rise in the form of\nRey, a 19 year-old girl and a Force-sensitive scavenger from Jakku;\nFinn, a stormtrooper who defected from the First Order; and Poe Dameron,\nthe best pilot in the Resistance. They are aided by Han Solo in their\nsearch for Skywalker and their mission to destroy the First Order's new\nsuperweapon, Starkiller Base, which targets the New Republic and the\nResistance for destruction. They are opposed by villains such as Kylo\nRen, a dark warrior with a mysterious past; and General Armitage Hux,\nthe commander of Starkiller Base. Despite initially claiming that the\nStar Wars story ended with the redemption of Anakin Skywalker in Return\nof the Jedi, and after spending years refuting speculation that there\nwould be another film, Star Wars creator George Lucas began work on\nEpisode VII in 2011 in order to increase the value of Lucasfilm before\nhe sold it to The Walt Disney Company, although Disney would later elect\nto not use Lucas' story. The acquisition was finalized on October 30,\n2012. Disney and Lucasfilm officially announced Episode VII and the\nsequel trilogy the same day. Lucasfilm later announced that the film\nwould be an original story not beholden to the continuity of the Star\nWars Expanded Universe, which was rebranded as the non-canon Star Wars\nLegends. The Force Awakens was released on December 17, 2015 in the\nUnited Kingdom, Mexico, Latin America, and Asian countries; December 18,\n2015 in North America; and January 9, 2016 in China. Some North American\ntheaters offered special limited advance showings on the evening of\nDecember 17th rather than the traditional midnight showing. The film\nreceived widespread critical praise upon its release and was a massive\nbox office success, becoming the highest grossing film of all time in\nNorth America when not adjusted for inflation. Worldwide, the film was\nthe third highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release\n(behind Avatar and Titanic). It is currently the fourth highest-grossing\nfilm of all time (behind Avengers: Endgame, Avatar and Titanic).
